The official [PentestTools.com](https://pentest-tools.com/) Github Action.

This action allows [light website scans](https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner) through PentestTools.com using the `ptt` interface.

**NOTE: This is an early version and will need time to become stable.**

# Usage
You can look into the [test-action.yml](https://github.com/pentesttoolscom/pentesttools-github-action/blob/TOOLS-1876-github-action/.github/workflows/test-action.yml) file for a few examples.

```yml
- name: Actual test
uses: pentesttoolscom/pentesttools-github-action@master
id: ptt
with:
    target: example.com # Has to be accessible to our scanners: https://pentest-tools.com/whitelist-ipv4.txt
    format: text # Human readable text. JSON is also available
    fail: low # The run will fail if a vulnerability with at least a low risk is found
- name: Print the output
run: echo "The report: ${{ steps.ptt.outputs.result }}"
```
